## 1. Generative AI Tool Used

**Tool**: Google Gemini

## 2. Manner of Use

Throughout the entire project lifecycle, the generative AI tool was employed as an interactive assistant. The development process was dialogic in natureâ€”initiated by requirements derived from the assessment brief and followed by AI-generated recommendations and technical guidance.

Specific use cases include:

### Architecture Design  
The AI proposed an initial serverless architecture based on the stated non-functional requirements (availability, scalability, and maintainability). It recommended the use of **Amazon API Gateway**, **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon DynamoDB**, and **Amazon EventBridge**, along with justifications for each. Final architectural decisions were made after additional literature review and technical validation by myself.

### Code Initialization
The AI provided initial code scaffolding and implementation suggestions for various components of the project. These were subsequently modified, refined, and extended by me. AI-assisted code contributions include:

- Python source code for all **seven AWS Lambda functions**
- **Terraform configuration (main.tf)** for infrastructure-as-code and automated provisioning of AWS resources
- **k6 load testing script (k6-test.js)**, covering functional, performance, and failure scenarios
- **PlantUML code** for C4 and UML sequence diagrams included in the report
- **Shell deployment script (deploy.sh)** to automate build and deployment workflows

### Debugging and Troubleshooting  
The AI played a critical role in resolving numerous technical challenges encountered during local development and cloud deployment. This included step-by-step diagnostics and solutions related to:

- Local environment configuration (Docker networking, `npm`, `brew`, AWS CLI)
- Syntax and logic errors in Terraform code
- Integration issues across AWS services

### Documentation and Reporting  
The AI assisted in drafting the overall structural outline of the `report.md` document, which was later populated, revised, and finalized by me.

## 3. Extent of Use

The generative AI tool functioned as a key advisor and technical assistant. It contributed initial direction and scaffolding for architecture design and code implementation, and continuously supported problem-solving throughout the development cycle. My role consisted of interpreting the AI's suggestions, performing hands-on implementation, conducting testing, and completing final integration of all components. The final deliverables are the result of a human-led process informed by AI-assisted collaboration.
